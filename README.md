## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a **city name**
2. The city name is converted into **latitude & longitude** using the **Geocoding API**
3. Weather data is fetched from the **Open-Meteo Forecast API**
4. The UI dynamically updates with:
   - 🌡 Current weather
   - ⏰ Hourly forecast
   - 📅 7-day forecast

All operations run entirely **client-side**, ensuring **fast performance** and simplicity.
